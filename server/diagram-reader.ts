// the SVG. Nothing here re-implements Mermaid's grammar.
//
// Mermaid runs in a worker thread of its own (diagram-reader-worker.mjs), inside
// a jsdom window, because its label handling uses DOMPurify, which needs a DOM.
// This module owns that worker: started on the first read, one read at a time,
// each read bounded by READ_DEADLINE_MS; a worker that fails, exits or overruns
// is discarded and the next read starts a new one. The worker does not keep the
